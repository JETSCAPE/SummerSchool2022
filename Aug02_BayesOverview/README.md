# Bayesian parameter estimation Overview

### For sessions on Aug 02, 2022

1. Most of the dependencies are already provided by the jetscape docker. For exercises on Aug. 2 and 3, you may need to install some packages by running the following from the jetscape docker:

```bash
pip3 install Gpy
```

2. Since the materials is quite dense, please make sure before the hands-on session that all modules and essential data files can be loaded properly.
To do so, run the jupyter notebook from the jetscape docker as instructed in the main README

```bash
jupyter-notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser
```

and then open this notebook 

```bash
20220802 Hands-on Session_Bayesian Analysis I.ipynb
```

Try if you can run through the first few blocks which loads all necessary packages and the pregenerated emulator files. Please post on slack if you encounter any problems.
