# Hands-on: Hadronic transport approach SMASH

## Goals for this session
1. Learn how to run SMASH within JETSCAPE as a hadronic afterburner
2. Understand SMASH's in- and outputs
3. Learn how the afterburner effects the resulting spectra


## Brief physics background on SMASH

See also lecture from yesterday. SMASH can also be used on its own for low-energy collisions.


### Future references for SMASH

## 1) Run and compile JETSCAPE with SMASH

## 2) SMASH's in- and outputs

## 3) Afterburner effects on spectra
