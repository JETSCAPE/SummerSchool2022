## Bayesian analysis with JETSCAPE STAT package

The exercise is in the STAT repository.

Please clone the STAT repository, and checkout the `JetScapeSummerSchool2022` branch. Note that you can do
this outside of the docker container:

```bash
# Go back to the main software directory for the school to start from a standardized location
cd ~/jetscape-docker
# Move into the STAT repository
cd STAT/
# Grab the branch for today's hands-on
git pull
git checkout JetScapeSummerSchool2022
```

We will be using the `hands-on-2022.ipynb` jupyter notebook. Note that we also need to install some
particular versions of dependencies for this package (especially `emcee`). We'll install them (or confirm that
they're already installed) during the hands-on session
